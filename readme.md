# 20keyrgb

A short description of the keyboard/project

Keyboard Maintainer: [Snyderitis](https://github.com/snyderitis)  
Hardware Supported: The kicad files for the PCB are in the "RGB keyboard" folder. 
Hardware Availability: I used WS2812B leds with 0.1uF SMD capacitors and a teensy. In the future it would be wiser to use an Arduino Pro mini as they're essentially the same and have the same pin layout.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make 20keyrgb:default

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/make_instructions.html) for more information.
